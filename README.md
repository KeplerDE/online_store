This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).


This project is an advanced ecommerce platform designed to provide a comprehensive shopping experience, powered by Next.js and the latest web technologies.

## Overview

Built with the future of web development in mind, this ecommerce application leverages Next.js 13, allowing for server-side rendering and static site generation to ensure fast loading times and a smooth user experience. 

It features a robust user authentication system, dynamic product listings, a sophisticated search and filter capability, and a complete checkout process with integrated payment solutions.

## Getting Started


First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
